## Question 2

Describe GitHub, **briefly** in your own words.

A place where you can share your code publicly to work with another person remotely or as a group. This allows you to make changes and upload them to GitHub whenever you want to share a change you made to your code.

## Question 3

```js
(false || true) && (false && true);
```

Is the value of this expression `true` or `false`?  Explain your answer.

False, the reason is because it sees false first and automatically stops looking at whats after false resulting in a falsey statement.

## Question 4

```js
var x = 1;
while (x < 5) {
  x = x + x;
}
```

How many times does the loop run?  What's the value of `x` after the while loop?

It runs three times and the value of 'x' after it is all said and done is 8.

## Question 5

```js
var strangeAdd = function(a, b) {
  if (a > 0 || b > 0) {
    return a + b;
  }
  return a - b;
};

var result = strangeAdd(0, -5);
```

What is the value of result?  Explain your answer.

Undefined, it does not equal anything....

## Question 6

```js
var groceryList = [
  'a loaf a bread',
  'a container of milk',
  'a stick of butter',
];
```

What is the value of `groceryList[2]`?

'a stick of butter'

## Question 7

```js
var teamMember = {
  role: 'consultant',
  name: {
    given: 'Jason',
    surname: 'Weeks'
  },
  hobby: 'exercise'
};
```

What is the value of `teamMember['hobby']`?  Of `teamMember['name']`?  Of
`teamMember['name']['surname']`?

'teamMember['hobby']' = 'exercise', `teamMember['name']` = 'Jason' 'Weeks', `teamMember['name']['surname']` = 'Weeks'
